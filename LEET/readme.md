# LEETCODE

Leetcode provides a convenient method of studying algorithms by providing code regarding the input and output of the problem. I will be studying Problem Solving using leetcode.

## Previous Knowledge

At this point (2023/12/28), I have a basic understanding of trees, data structures, and basic algorithm concepts such as brute force, DFS, BFS, binary search, etc. However, I require practice as I have forgot many things and can't apply them right away. I also have trouble applying more sophisticated concepts such as applications of dynamic programming along with other topics.

Language: I have attempted PS in C++, java, and python but I will proceed with python as it is the language most familiar to me. I want to avoid having a language barrier as the goal is to be familiar and focus entirely on the algorithms.

## Goals
**Short Term (1M: 2024/1):** <br>
Get comfortable with algorithms and be able to differentiate which algorithm should be used for given problems.
<br> 

**Long Term (3M: 2024/3):** <br>
Reach Gold in Baekjoon and be able to solve most gold problems within an hour.
