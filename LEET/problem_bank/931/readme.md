## 931. Minimum Falling Path Sum

### Problem Definition
Given an n x n array of integers matrix, return the minimum sum of any falling path through matrix.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses the element in the next row that is either directly below or diagonally left/right. Specifically, the next element from position (row, col) will be (row + 1, col - 1), (row + 1, col), or (row + 1, col + 1).

### Approach
Discuss the approach you took to solve the problem. Include any initial thoughts, how you broke down the problem, and if there were any specific algorithms or data structures you considered.

### Solution
